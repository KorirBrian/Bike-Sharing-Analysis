                                                     **Project Overview**


1. Company Profile

Capital Bikeshare Ltd is a company based in Washington D.C that provides bike sharing services. 

2. Problem Statement

Bike sharing is a fundamental service, commonly used in the urban mobility sector. It is easily accessible (as no driving license is required to ride a bike), is cheaper than normal car sharing services (since bike maintenance and insurance are substantially 
cheaper than automobile ones). 

Therefore, understanding the driving factors of bike sharing requests is essential for both the company and users. Moreover, understanding the Data from a company's perspective; 

 1. Identifying the expected bike demand in a specific area, within a specific time frame, can significantly increase revenue and customer 
    satisfaction. 
 2. Bike relocation can be optimized to further reduce operational costs. 
 
 3. From the customers point of view, probably the most important factor is bike availability in the shortest wait time.
 
We will analyze bike sharing data from Capital Bikeshar, for the period between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. The data is aggregated on an hourly basis. Also, additional meteorological information is available in the data, which could serve as a driving factor for identifying the total number of requests for a  specific time frame (bad weather conditions could have a substantial impact on bike sharing demand).
